---My Changelog (Ethan, July 27 2:20PM)---
Major function: An extra wall spawns every specified move (from settings file)
	These new walls can't spawn in areas that are not EMPTY. (AKA will cause holes in wall around win area, buttons, barriers, etc.)
	The walls can be reset to their original count by pressing the "R" tile
	When the "R" tile is pressed, it also moves itself to a new random location on the gameboard

Adjusted message in bottom to specify how the buttons and wall regen work
Turned down # of start walls to 5 since walls begin spawning in
Made the win position a more distinguishable colour (Purple)



---Issues / Suggestions---
Button spawned in the barrier one time - Couldn't reach it (This happened prior to me adding my code)
Maybe decrease stupidity factor in file a tiny bit? (Say, 25%?). This will make it look slightly harder in the video demo
Don't forget to remove all the cout's prior to demonstration
